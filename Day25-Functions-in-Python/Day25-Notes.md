# Day 25: Functions in Python

## Introduction
A **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.  
Functions help us:
- Avoid code repetition
- Make programs cleaner and readable
- Break large problems into smaller parts

Python provides **built-in functions** and also allows us to create **user-defined functions**.

## 1. What is a Function?
A function:
- Has a name
- Can take input (parameters)
- Can return output

Example of built-in functions:
- `print()`
- `len()`
- `type()`

## 2. Creating a Function

### Syntax
```python
def function_name():
    # code block

## Example
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to Python!")
```

## 3. Calling a Function
* A function runs only when it is called.
`greet()`
