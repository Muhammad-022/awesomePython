# Day 43: What is OOP, Class, and Object

## What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where I organize code using objects and classes.  
It helps represent real-world entities in programming.

Examples of real-world objects:
- Student
- Car
- Book
- Mobile

## What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.

Example:
Class: Student  
Objects: Ahmad, Ali, Sara  

So:
Class → category  
Object → real instance  

## What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class.

Example:
Class: Student  
Object: Ahmad  

Multiple objects can be created from one class.

## Basic Syntax of Class and Object

```python
class ClassName:
    pass

obj = ClassName()
