# Day 10: If–Else Statements in Python

Conditional statements help a program make decisions based on conditions.

## Why If–Else is Important
- Allows programs to react differently in different situations
- Controls the flow of a program
- Helps in decision-making
- Prevents unnecessary calculations

## Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # code to execute if condition is False
