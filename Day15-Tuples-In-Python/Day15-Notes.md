# Day 15: Tuples in Python

Tuples are an ordered and immutable data structure in Python.
Immutable means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.
Tuples are similar to lists, but their immutability makes them safer and faster in certain situations. They are also useful when you want to ensure that the data remains constant.

## 1. Creating Tuples
* Tuples are created using parentheses ().
* Tuples can store different data types in a single tuple.

## 2. Accessing Tuple Items
* Indexing in tuples is zero-based.
* Negative indices can be used to access items from the end.

## 3. Tuple Length
* The len() function returns the total number of items in the tuple.

## 4. Tuple Slicing
* Use start:end index to slice a tuple.
* The end index is exclusive.

## 5. Checking Item Existence
* The in keyword checks if an item exists in a tuple.

## 6. Tuple with One Item
* Comma , is required for a single-item tuple.
* Writing (10) alone will be considered an integer, not a tuple.

## 7. Nested Tuple
* Tuples can contain other tuples.
* To access nested items, first use the outer index, then the inner index.
